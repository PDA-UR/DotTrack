# Data Sets

Raw sensor images recorded automatically (see ../auto_capture) on different surfaces:

 * 100g: Standard office paper (100g)
 * glossy: Glossy printer paper
 * photo: Glossy photo paper
 * acrylic: Transparent acrylic on a white surface
 * acrylic_image: Transparent acrylic on a printed image

To compare the different surfaces visually, images of the same spot on different materials can be found in 'sensor_images'.

To evaluate how well the system works in practice, we recorded data while the tangible was moved over a surface continuously (dataset_evaluation_moving).

We also asked a person unfamiliar with the system to lay down the tangible on the pattern repeatedly and recorded images each time (dataset_evaluation_laydown).
