# Tracking Pattern

This directory contains different versions of the De-Bruijn-based tracking pattern used by DotTrack:

 * ```dbt-8192x4096_5x5.png```: Complete De-Bruijn Torus used by DotTrack. It is 8192x4096 pixels in size and each 5x5 dot window encodes a position.
 * ```dbt-8192x4096_5x5_150x150dpi-A4.pdf```: Crop of the pattern's top left corner that can be printed on A4 paper. We recommend this for testing the system or comparing different printers/types of paper.
 * ```dbt-8192x4096_5x5-A4_tiled.pdf```: Complete De-Bruijn pattern, but cut into A4 segments so it can be easily printed with a standard printer and then glued together with transparent tape. This results in a sheet of about 137 by 70 cm.
